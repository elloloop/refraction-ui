- [ ] Implement styled wrapper with theme integration
- [ ] Add positioning and alignment logic
- [ ] Implement trigger interaction handling
- [ ] Add arrow indicator support
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (ARIA, screen reader support)
- [ ] Add animation and transition support
- [ ] Implement responsive design patterns
- [ ] Add theme integration with CSS custom properties
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Write Storybook stories for all variants
- [ ] Add accessibility tests with Axe
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis
- [ ] Create documentation and examples

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties with theme integration
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and minimal re-renders
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and accessibility tests
- **Documentation**: Storybook stories and JSDoc comments

## Popover Types

- **tooltip**: Simple text tooltip
- **content**: Rich content popover
- **menu**: Menu-style popover
- **form**: Form input popover

## Popover Positions

- **top**: Above trigger (default)
- **bottom**: Below trigger
- **left**: Left of trigger
- **right**: Right of trigger
- **auto**: Automatic positioning based on available space

## Popover Triggers

- **hover**: Opens on hover
- **click**: Opens on click
- **focus**: Opens on focus
- **manual**: Controlled by parent component

## Notes

- Follow React best practices for component design
- Ensure proper semantic HTML and accessibility
- Support for both controlled and uncontrolled usage
- Consider performance implications of positioning calculations
- Include proper error boundaries and error handling
- Support for SSR and hydration
