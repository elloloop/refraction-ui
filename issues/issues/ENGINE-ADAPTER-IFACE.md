## Summary

EngineAdapter interface and contract tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `EngineAdapter` interface defines contract for component engines
- [ ] Interface supports component registration and retrieval
- [ ] Interface supports theme integration and customization
- [ ] Interface supports accessibility features and ARIA attributes
- [ ] Interface supports event handling and callbacks
- [ ] Interface supports ref forwarding and DOM manipulation
- [ ] Interface supports composition patterns (children, asChild)
- [ ] Interface supports responsive design and breakpoints
- [ ] Interface supports animation and transition hooks
- [ ] Interface supports validation and error handling
- [ ] Contract tests verify interface compliance
- [ ] Contract tests cover all required methods and properties
- [ ] Contract tests validate type safety and constraints
- [ ] Contract tests ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Interface supports multiple engine implementations
- [ ] Interface supports engine-specific optimizations
- [ ] Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify engine compatibility

## Tasks

- [ ] Define EngineAdapter interface with TypeScript
- [ ] Create component registration system
- [ ] Add theme integration methods
- [ ] Implement accessibility support
- [ ] Add event handling interface
- [ ] Create ref forwarding support
- [ ] Add composition pattern support
- [ ] Implement responsive design hooks
- [ ] Add animation and transition support
- [ ] Create validation and error handling
- [ ] Write comprehensive contract tests
- [ ] Add type safety validation
- [ ] Create backward compatibility tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Write documentation and examples

## Technical Requirements

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom engine implementations
- **Performance**: Optimized for runtime performance
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility guarantees
- **Testing**: Comprehensive contract testing
- **Documentation**: Clear interface documentation

## EngineAdapter Interface

```typescript
interface EngineAdapter {
  // Component management
  registerComponent(name: string, component: Component): void;
  getComponent(name: string): Component | null;

  // Theme integration
  applyTheme(theme: Theme): void;
  getTheme(): Theme;

  // Accessibility
  enhanceAccessibility(component: Component): Component;

  // Event handling
  handleEvent(event: Event): void;

  // Composition
  compose(component: Component, props: Props): Component;
}
```

## Contract Tests

- **Interface Compliance**: Verify all required methods exist
- **Type Safety**: Validate parameter and return types
- **Behavior Consistency**: Ensure consistent behavior across engines
- **Performance**: Benchmark engine performance
- **Accessibility**: Verify accessibility compliance

## Notes

- Must support multiple component libraries (Radix, Headless UI, etc.)
- Consider performance implications of adapter pattern
- Ensure type safety across different engine implementations
- Support for engine-specific features and optimizations
- Provide clear migration path between engines
