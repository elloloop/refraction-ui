- [ ] Button supports all standard button attributes (type, disabled, etc.)
- [ ] Button supports multiple variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive
- [ ] Button supports multiple sizes: sm, md, lg, xl
- [ ] Button supports loading state with spinner and disabled interaction
- [ ] Button supports icon-only mode with proper accessibility

- [ ] Button supports proper event handling (onClick, onFocus, onBlur, etc.)
- [ ] Button supports ref forwarding
- [ ] Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Storybook stories for all variants and states
- [ ] Axe accessibility tests with 0 violations
- [ ] Bundle size <5KB (gzipped)
- [ ] Performance: renders in <16ms

## Tasks

- [ ] Create Button primitive component with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Implement styled wrapper with theme integration
- [ ] Add variant and size prop handling
- [ ] Implement loading state with spinner component
- [ ] Add icon support with proper positioning
- [ ] Implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add theme integration with CSS custom properties
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Write Storybook stories for all variants
- [ ] Add accessibility tests with Axe
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis
- [ ] Create documentation and examples

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties with theme integration
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and minimal re-renders
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and accessibility tests
- **Documentation**: Storybook stories and JSDoc comments

## Button Variants

1. **Primary**: Solid background with high contrast
2. **Secondary**: Outlined or subtle background
3. **Outline**: Transparent with border
4. **Ghost**: Minimal styling with hover effects
5. **Destructive**: Red/danger styling for destructive actions

## Button Sizes

- **sm**: 32px height, small text
- **md**: 40px height, normal text (default)
- **lg**: 48px height, larger text
- **xl**: 56px height, large text

## Notes

- Follow React best practices for component design
- Ensure proper semantic HTML and accessibility
- Support for both controlled and uncontrolled usage
- Consider performance implications of styling and theming
- Include proper error boundaries and error handling
